##Installation
If you haven't already done so, install grunt-init.

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your ~/.grunt-init/ directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

'''
git clone git@github.com:bwhyte21/grunt-init-grunttestjs.git ~/.grunt-init/grunttestjs
'''

##Usage
At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

'''
grunt-init grunttestjs
'''

_Note that this is a test template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
